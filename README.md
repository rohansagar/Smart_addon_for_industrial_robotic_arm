This project was done for the Mechatronics class at San Francisco State University. This project is a device that adds wireless color sensing capability to the Gencobot industrial robotic arm form Genmark. It consists of transmitter and a receiver units. The transmitter uses Adafruit Color sensor to sense the colors which are then transmitted to the receiver unit using HC-05 bluetooth module. The receiver is plugged into the computer which uses Matlab to read the colors and control the arm. It was implemented to perform the objective that was set by the Professor.
In addition to this we also designed a lab to learn how to operate the lab.
